# My CV

CV is built with HTML and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

Tools:
* Yarn
* [Just](https://github.com/casey/just)
* Tmux


### Dev setup
* `cd` into project dir
* `yarn install`
* Use `just dev` to start server and Tailwind in watch mode

NOTE: there is a pre-commit hook to minify & bundle css and to generate pdf.
